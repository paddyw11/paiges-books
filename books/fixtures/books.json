The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his society's suppression of knowledge and culture. As Montag begins to question the purpose of his work and the emptiness of his life, he is drawn into a dangerous rebellion against the authoritarian regime that seeks to control thought by destroying books. \n\nBradbury’s chilling vision of a world without literature and critical thinking serves as both a cautionary tale and a timeless commentary on the power of ideas. 'Fahrenheit 451' is a searing indictment of censorship and the perils of complacency in the face of authoritarianism, making it a classic of dystopian literature."

The story unfolds on a farm where the animals, led by the pigs, revolt against their human owner, Mr. Jones. They establish a new government based on the principle of equality, but as time passes, the pigs begin to assume greater power and privileges, leading to a society that mirrors the very tyranny they sought to escape.\n\nThrough the rise and fall of the animal regime, Orwell critiques totalitarianism and the betrayal of revolutionary ideals. The familiar phrases 'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others' resonate with readers as a cautionary tale about the fragility of freedom and the ease with which power can corrupt. 'Animal Farm' remains a timeless reflection on the nature of authority and the complex interplay between freedom and oppression."
