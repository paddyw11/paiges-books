## Bugs

### Search query field error

---

![Image](/documentation/media/images/bug1.png)

Once I had creatd a new table for genre, in order to make it a manyToMany relationshipe i hadn't updated the search query to reflect that. I needed to update to correct syntax.

### HTML Validation Error on allauth password validator form

---

![Image](/documentation/media/images/bug3.png)

---

![Image](/documentation/media/images/bug3-1.png)

---

I was receiving a W3C validation error on this due to the django password validator and crispy_forms displaying the password vlaidation hints as a list within a small element. 
I attempted to create the form using crispy fields for the other fields and custom design the password1 field. 
![Image](/documentation/media/images/bug3-2.png)I decided it was a better UX to leave the whole form as a crispy fomr in the end.
